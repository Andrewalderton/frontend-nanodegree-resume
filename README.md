Interactive Resume
==================

## Description

Second project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course.

Interactive resume built using JavaScript, which contains links to previous projects/courses, as well as contact information and a Google Map displaying where I have lived and worked.

## Usage

To run the site, you can download the files, or clone the repository, and then open the `index.html` file in your browser.

The site can also be viewed live [here](http://andrewalderton.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-resume).
